******************* revised *********************
Hey there fellow math enthusiasts! Let's dive into the crazy world of quadratic equations, shall we? I've stumbled upon this little beauty: 2x² + 6x + 2 = 0. Can you help me find its roots? Remember, we're looking for the values of x that make this equation true. So, let's get our thinking caps on and see if we can crack this one together! Don't forget to show your work, because I'm curious to see if we can do this the old-fashioned way, without a calculator. Let's go, team!

Hey there fellow math enthusiasts! Let's dive into the crazy world of quadratic equations, shall we? I've stumbled upon this little beauty: 2x² + 6x + 2 = 0. Can you help me find its roots? Remember, we're looking for the values of x that make this equation true. So, let's get our thinking caps on and see if we can crack this one together! Don't forget to show your work, because I'm curious to see if we can do this the old-fashioned way, without a calculator. Let's go, team!

Remember, we're looking for the values of x that make this equation true. So, let's get our thinking caps on and see if we can crack this one together! Don't forget to show your work, because I'm curious to see if we can do this the old-fashioned way, without a calculator. Let's go, team!
********************logic answer*************
$x = \left(\frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)$
**************ground truth************
((-0.382, -2.618)) = (\frac{-6 + \sqrt{20}}{2*2}, (\frac{-6 - \sqrt{20}}{2*2})
